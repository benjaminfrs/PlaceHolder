# [Working Title] Design Document

## What is [Working Title]?
[Working Title] will be a premier action roguelike title developed by Rune Byte Games. Inspiration comes from Diablo, Path of Exile, Grim Dawn, Last Epoch, Siralim series, and Slay the Spire. [Working Title] will deconstruct and examine the guiding design prinicples of these inspiriations in order to bring fresh ideas to the ***Hack'n'Slash*** genre.

## Design Pillars
- Non-linear progression to build and complete characters
- Classless build design
- Difficulty scaling instead of power restriction
- Respect the player's time investment

### Non-linear progression to build and complete characters
The ***Hack'n'Slash*** genre is built around replayability, creativity, and curiousity. Too often linear set pieces and story modes get stale, and players have to dredge through the same experience again and again. [Working Title] will have a difficulty scaling module that will allow the player to determine which content they will consume in order to progress. In games like Path of Exile, Grim Dawn, and Last Epoch, the player must proceed through the story in order to complete specific quests that provide rewards that increase player power. [Working Title] will automatically introduce the player to new gameplay systems and additional power simply throughout the course of play.

### Classless build design
In ***Hack'n'Slash*** games, the player is typically given a choice between classes. These classes are at the basic level a collection of class specific passive modifiers and class specific active abilities. Classes usually have several different archetypes that the game designer believes the player will be interested in. The class system restricts creativity and replayability. [Working Title]'s innovative ***Goblin Breeding Program<sup>TM</sup>*** will provide the player with the building blocks to create truly unique build designs that are not restricted by a class based system. 

### Difficulty scaling instead of power restriction
A frequent occurence in ***Hack'n'Slash*** games is the discovery of a powerful build archetype that is a given a quick death once the developer catches wind. [Working Title] will strive to provide a very flexible character build system that results in a wide of variety of strong archetypes. With [Working Title]'s difficulty scaling module, players can always face ever increasing challenge and push their build to the limit.

### Respect the player's time investment
The ***Hack'n'Slash*** genre is a casino filled with rigged machines. In Path of Exile, there is often a way to deterministically craft items, but it requires so much built up currency that a player must utilize the trade system in order to craft the most powerful items for themselves. In ***Hack'n'Slash*** games the gameplay cadence is kill something, drop something, check that something, pick up something if it's an upgrade for you or another of your characters, otherwise go kill something. [Working Title] will solve both of these problems with its innovative ***Goblin Breeding Program<sup>TM</sup>***. More on that in the gameplay section.

## Story
In the world of [Working World Name], there are a wide variety of sentient creatures and races. Goblins are one such variety of sentient creatures. Goblins have widely been hunted by adventurers for their blood which has healing, as well as other mysterious, properties [TODO: come up with better reason for why goblins are hunted...]. Goblins are renowned for their engineering, craftmanship, and attention to detail. The player is an adventurer seeking fame and fortune in the world of [Working World Name]. In the opening scenes of the game, the player comes across a starving goblin. Moved by the plight of the goblin, the player offers the goblin some of their dwindling supplies. The goblin is grateful and gives the players instructions for reaching one of the few remaining goblin sanctuaries to be rewarded for their timely aid.

### Goblin Sanctuary
Upon reaching the goblin sanctuary, the player is greeted by [Enigmactic Goblin Engineer] who has been briefed on the player's merciful aid. Knowing the tempatation that the player faced to simply harvest the blood of the starving goblin, [Enigmactic Goblin Engineer] describes the plight of the goblin race and the hope of restoration. The player is moved by the cause of the dying race and enlists to help restore the goblins to their former glory. The sanctuary is filled with a variety of useful goblin machinery that will end up being vital over the course of the player's journey to restore the goblins to strength.

### Themes
- Mystical engineering goblins
  - World of Warcraft whimsical and playful gadgets
  - Harry Potter magic infused engineering
  - Diablo inspired greed and love for loot
- Empathy for a race on the brink of extinction
- Moral Complexity
    - Interracial conflict
    - Resource scarcity
    - Breeding/genetic manipulation
- Exploitation of nature

## Gameplay
[Working Title] is a top down action focused game. The camera perspective will be 3rd person with the ability to rotate and change perspective (very similar to Grim Dawn or Diablo's camera). We use this camera perspective to allow the player to have a strategic bird's eye view as well as feel immersed in [Working Title]'s world. [Working Title] will also have account wide progression systems including the ***Goblin Breeding Program<sup>TM</sup>*** that take inspiration from other genres.

### Gameplay Loop
The core gameplay loop will consist of:
1. Configuring the biome from the portal generator (i.e map device)
    - The player can change the environment textures, potential rewards, difficulty scaling, and mission spawns for a biome
2. Entering the biome
3. Complete the biome until missions are complete or sufficient resources have been collected
4. Return to the hub which contains the portal generator
5. Engage with account wide progression systems [TODO: expand upon this section]

### Portal Generator
The portal generator is similar to Path of Exile's map device. In the world of [Working World Name], the portal generator is a mystical goblin crafted device originally used to hunt down coveted natural resources. Throughout the course of the game, the player will receive missions to upgrade the portal generator by recovering missing components. The player will be able to control the difficulty, rewards, and terrain of generated portals. Once the portal generator is fully upgraded, the player will be able to fully customize their gameplay experience and target the rewards they are hunting. The portal generator can easily be expanded upon in future content releases (i.e enter unpredictably modified portals for increased challenge and rewards).

### ***Goblin Breeding Program<sup>TM</sup>***
In [Working Title] one of the main goals of the player will be to restore the population of goblins who have slowly been going extinct due to over zealous adventurers. The player will find goblins out in the wild and be able to send them back to base with [Goblin Technology]. Goblins are resourceful engineers and crafters, each with their own specialties and strengths. Once a goblin has returned to base, it can be put to work in various workshops in order to craft equipment and runes for the player. ***Goblins will passively work on crafting projects while the player is out completing biomes and missions, and when the player returns to base, they will be greeted with a shower of loot from the goblins' crafting endeavors***.

This crafting system will solve the problem of the typical kill, loot, kill cycle found in ***Hack'n'Slash*** titles. The moment to moment gameplay will not be interrupted by sifting through loot on the ground. ***Instead the player can play until they get bored and fuel their dopamine by checking the results of finished crafting projects that might unlock new archetypes and builds***.

Due to the goblins' dwindling population, there is a goblin counsel funded incentive program for goblins that bring offspring to bear. Goblins that reproduce will have children with similar or improved engineering and crafting capabilities. Goblins will naturally reproduce, but the player can artifically control pairings by using an aphrodesiac harvested from the world. By finding goblin pairs that have similar strengths, the player can create goblins that create stronger and more targeted loot ***(i.e parents that both produce flame infused swords will produce offspring that produce stronger flame infused swords)***.

***Hack'n'Slash*** games generally feature equipable items with a number of modifiers on the items(i.e more fire damage, more health, increased defenses, etc.). The ***Goblin Breeding Program<sup>TM</sup>*** will shift these modifiers to goblins that will craft items with their goblin modifiers. This system will enable passive loot generation and will let the player decide when they wish to engage with the loot system.

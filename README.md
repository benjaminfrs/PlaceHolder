# [Working Title] Design Document

## What is [Working Title]?
[Working Title] will be a premier action roguelike title developed by Rune Byte Games. Inspiration comes from Diablo, Path of Exile, Grim Dawn, Last Epoch, Siralim series, and Slay the Spire. [Working Title] will deconstruct and examine the guiding design prinicples of these inspiriations in order to bring fresh ideas to the ***Hack'n'Slash*** genre.

## Design Pillars
- Non-linear progression to build and complete characters
- Classless build design
- Difficulty scaling instead of power restriction
- Respect the player's time investment

### Non-linear progression to build and complete characters
The ***Hack'n'Slash*** genre is built around replayability, creativity, and curiousity. Too often linear set pieces and story modes get stale, and players have to dredge through the same experience again and again. [Working Title] will have a difficulty scaling module that will allow the player to determine which content they will consume in order to progress. In games like Path of Exile, Grim Dawn, and Last Epoch, the player must proceed through the story in order to complete specific quests that provide rewards that increase player power. [Working Title] will automatically introduce the player to new gameplay systems and additional power simply based upon time played.

### Classless build design
In ***Hack'n'Slash*** games, the player is typically given a choice between classes. These classes are at the basic level a collection of class specific passive modifiers and class specific active abilities. Classes usually have several different archetypes that the game designer believes the player will be interested in. The class system restricts creativity and replayability. [Working Title]'s innovative ***Goblin Breeding Program<sup>TM</sup>*** will provide the player with the building blocks to create truly unique build designs that are not restricted by a class based system. 

### Difficulty scaling instead of power restriction
A frequent occurence in ***Hack'n'Slash*** games is the discovery of a powerful build archetype that is a given a quick death once the developer catches wind. [Working Title] will strive to provide a very flexible character build system that results in a wide of variety of strong archetypes. With [Working Title]'s difficulty scaling module, players can always face ever increasing challenge and push their build to the limit.

### Respect the player's time investment
The ***Hack'n'Slash*** genre is a casino filled with rigged machines. In Path of Exile, there is often a way to deterministically craft items, but it requires so much built up currency that a player must utilize the trade system in order to craft the most powerful items for themselves. In ***Hack'n'Slash*** games the gameplay cadence is kill something, drop something, check that something, pick up something if it's an upgrade for you or another of your characters, otherwise go kill something. [Working Title] will solve both of these problems with its innovative ***Goblin Breeding Program<sup>TM</sup>***. More on that in the gameplay section.

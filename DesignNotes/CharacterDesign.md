# [Working Title] Character Build and Design

## Random Item Generation

Action RPG titles that generate random loot have a few considerations. What modifiers can roll onto an item? What numerical ranges are possible for each type of modifier that rolls? What are the names of the items that are generated? Typically games that do this categorize modifiers into **Prefixes** and **Sufixes**. An item contains an equal amount of **Prefixes** and **Sufixes**. The **Prefix** is also the prefix for the name of the item (i.e if one of the prefixes on the item is increased burning damage and the item is a sword, the name becomes 'Burning Sword'). The **Sufix** is also the sufix for the name of the item (i.e if one of the suffixes on the item is increased attack speed and the item is a sword, the item's name might become 'Sword of Alacrity'). This system handles both the naming conventions and modifier outcomes of items. [Working Title] says that this system is not ideal because it restricts item generation ***What if the player wants to create an item with modifiers that all happen to be prefixes?*** [Working Title] will use a item tagging system to handle the naming of items, and players will have the ability to hunt for items that have any combination of modifiers. Item tags will have pools of potential prefixes and suffixes tied to them to handle item name generation. ***Modifiers that modify burning damage will have the [Burning] tag which will have a pool of sufixes like [searing, scorching, burning] and prefixes like [heated, scorched, infernal]. Speed modifiers might have a name pool like [Quick, Haste, Rapidity], so an item with burning modifiers might have names like [Quick Sword of Searing, Infernal Blade of Haste]***. [Working Title] will feature unique item modifiers that offer build around effects without being on 'Unique' items that have fixed **Prefixes** and **Sufixes**.
